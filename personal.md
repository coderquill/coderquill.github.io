I was born in the middle of June'99, in a small town in India. I started walking and talking at a really young age. Aparently, at 1.5 years old, I was a fully functioning baby(a record my neice would break later). For most kids, it is their parent that teach them these things. For me, it was my brother. He taught me how to walk and talk, I was basically my sibling's toy! We are a big family, and it was really fun growing up. I took the full advantage of being the youngest and they completely let me, they still do!

At the age of 3, I started going to the school, and I was directly sent to the first grade. Now most kids in the class started with basic reading and writing. My brother, he must've been 11yo back then, started teaching me reading Marathi at home and soon, we were done. Now the next step was English. And he - it still astonishes me, he's a genius - taught me to read and write english by making phonetic comparisons between the two languages. I dont know how he got that idea but it was briliant and it worked. I started reading and writing English almost at the same time as Marathi. After the language introduction, we went into the basic mathematics. I leart it, and then we started our tables. I would learn one table per day and slowly, I was done with that as well. Basically I was done with my studies for upto the 3rd grade, by the age of 4. That meant, now I had all the time in the world to get hobbies, and I did. 

My introduction to reading was through the newspapers. My father would get 3-4 newspapers daily at home. As a kid, I wanted to know what is he reading, but the news wordings were too heavy for me. So I stared only reading the things that has pictures. Ok, this news has a picture, I will read it. This one doesn't, well, it's not important anyway. And I was hooked. I loved to read. My brother and father saw this. And they got me books! I remember I would read and read and read. I would even read textbooks of my sibilings. And Bhaiya was always there to fulfill my book demand. My mother was frustrated with our reading habits. At one point, we had a ban on reading at all!! She also hated newspapers because of us haha.

My brother himself was a kid, but for me, he was the most brilliant person in the world! He would have answers to all my questions and boy, did I have questions!! We would spend hours talking about everything. He would tell me there is something called gravity, and the earth revolves around the sun and how telephone works. And my little kid brain would be blown away. Oh what a time it was!

I also loved to paint and dance. And I have danced at many, many events. If there ever was a event, me and my father would be there. I just loved to dance, I still do. And I dare say, I am good at it! For painting, I don't do it as frequesntly as I used to, but it is something that calms me. And who doesn't like playing with colors?!

My brother is a poet. So naturally I had to copy him and I started writing things. I was especially good at essay writing and poems. I went on to win multiple awards for the same.

School was a breeze. I did not study much, but I read books. A lot of them. My school had a huge library and I took full advantage of it. There was a point when my friends would ask me how a book is because I must've read it and damn sure they were right! Fiction, History, Autobiography, I love it all. I started studying sincerely after grade 10, and have never looked back. As unpopular it is to say, but I love studying and I love exams haha. I chose to make my career in computer science(After claiming I am going to be a doctor till the age of 14!) and I really love it!

I consider it my absolute fortune that I was born in a culturally rich country like India. I can spend hours talking about all the aspects of Indian history and culture, both good and bad. My introduction to History was through the book named "Raja Shivchhatrapati". I read it when I was 9, at it still remains my favourite book. 

I am a practicing Hindu. My father - almost an atheist, and my mother is a devoted Hindu. I would sit beside her whenever she would do Pooja's and learnt all the mantra's and Aarti's. My maternal grandfather used to(he still does) read Dnyaneshwari(Marathi Geeta) and even though I didn't fully understand the meaning of it, I remember liking it. Sometimes I do have moments where I don't believe that god exists, but I always come back to it. Again, I love to question my own faith and get a deeper understanding of what it really means. I plan on reading and understanding Geeta someday. I strongly believe Ramayana and Mahabharata are one of the greatest literature pieces to ever have been written and I urge my readers to read them at least once. Not for religious purposes, but for the love of literature. They are the absolute gems.

Through this blog, I just want to put my thoughts out there, because I have many. I am always looking forward to having conversations with people. I love talking! Please feel free to contact me about anything on this page, if it resonated with you. I look forward to it. Thanks for reading :)
