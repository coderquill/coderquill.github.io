So, lets learn about vectors, shall we?
   A vector is a quantity having direction as well as magnitude. Right, but thats in physics context.
   In the programming context, vectors is nothing but a dynamic array, which means its an array where we dont have to declare its size and which can expand and shrink. 
   Thats pretty much it!
