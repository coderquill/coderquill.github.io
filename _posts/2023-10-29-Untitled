It’s been years since we last spoke,
And I still haven’t said goodbye
I refuse to admit that you have left,
that I’ll always be teary eyed

Oh wait, we did speak today,
When I told you how I nearly tripped 
And yesterday, 
when I got scared of that loud noise
Or a day before that, 
When I wore the last dress you bought for me
Or was it a day before, when I caught a milkweed by myself
And remembered all the ones you caught for me 

I still have your calls saved,
You asking me what do I want to eat 
I don’t have the guts to listen to them,
Was it a dream, a sweet deceit?

I remember how you always claimed proudly
That you loved me the most
And how foolish I was
To think that was the truth, the words I could blindly trust

Because if you did, 
You would be here right now,
Asking me whether I ate
Telling me to go to sleep immediately, because it is so late

Taking me to all the good shows
And sitting at the front rows
Feeding me, watching with glee,
Same order on repeat, just for me

Yet here I am, and you are not
And that's the unacceptable truth
The world tells me to accept it,
And it's a cruel route

How can I?
When I see you everyday in the mirror
Your eyes, the smile,
And the nose I used to look at with a jeer
But now I cherish it,
Because that's all I have of you that's left
I am a part of you,
A truth in my heart, deftly kept
