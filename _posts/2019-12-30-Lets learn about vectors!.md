So, lets learn about vectors, shall we?
   A vector is a quantity having direction as well as magnitude. Right, but thats in physics context.
   In C++, vector is a dynamic array where we dont have to declare its size and which can expand and shrink. i.e. Vectors are dynamically resizable arrays.
    Then why study vector and not just use arrays all the times?
    Because in the situation where you might not know the exact size of the array and you need to constantly add/remove its elements then we need to prefer vector.
    
     So in what other ways are vectors different from arrays?
     

<style>
table, th, td {
  border: 1px solid black;
  border-collapse: collapse;
}
</style>
<body>

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Vector</th>
    <th>Array</th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sequential containers</td>
    <td>Lower level data structure</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Dynamic nature</td>
    <td>Static nature</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Not index based(though indices can be used for accessing)</td>
    <td>Index Based</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Better for frequent insertion and deletion</td>
    <td>Better suited for frequent access of elements</td>
  </tr>
</table>

</body>



   
   
   
   Thats pretty much it!
