Just trying to rekindle my writing skills about different things.

Hello! I am Rupali, currently pursuing my masters at Carnegie Mellon University.
I have 2.5 years of industry experience, my most recent title being software Engineer 2 @Twilio.
As a experienced software professional, I have worn many hats throughout my career - from data engineer to data scientist to a full stack developer. With each new role, I have approached every challenge with a sense of excitement and eagerness to learn.
Recently, I dabbled into entrepreneurship with my own adventure "SilkSleep". I managed all facets of the business
with end-to-end management, and achieved an impressive 31.7% profit margin. Please check my detailed resume for more details.

Currently I am working as a research assistant with Diversity, Inclusion, Climate and Equity office at Heinz@CMU, under Dr. Dareen Basma. I am incredibally passionate about increasing women representation in STEM fields, tackling gender inequality and promoting inclusivity across all forums. With DICE office, I am exploring all the opportunities in that area.

At present, I am writing a book that I plan to publish by the end of this year.

I love being creative and working for a cause. Outside of my work, I have volunteered at teach for India, where I taught mathematics and english for class 4 students. My passions include dancing, reading, writing and painting. For my personal life story so far, please see the personal section. 

Please feel free to convey your thoughts and suggestions using any given medium about my blog posts!
